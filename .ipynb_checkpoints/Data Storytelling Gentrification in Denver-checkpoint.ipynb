    "### Why Gentrification?  \n",
    "Gentrification is becoming more and more of an issue as we see disadvantages communities pushed out of their neighborhoods while housing prices soar. I moved to Denver right after graduation college in 2016 and saw first hand how the city is changing, for better or for worse. I lived in Denver's historically black neighborhood, Five Points. When I looked around my neighborhood, I saw middle class white families walking their dogs, upscale fried chicken restuarants, and an expensive cafe juxatposed against a family owned sould food restuarant, and old-school car repair shop, and derilict houses that lined Welton Street. \n",
    "\n",
    "Digging into the history of Five Points, it became apparent that the neighborhood has undergone a serious change in the past couple of years. The fancy fried chicken joint had replaced a family owned fried chicken joint. What used to be small, low cost shops were now breweries and yoga studios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This all had devastating effects ont he black population of Five Points, who were driven out of their homes and further east where the cost of living was cheaper.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of your stance on gentrification, it will be valuable for developers and city officials to understand if a certain neighborhood is gentrifying. Being able to predict gentrification will allow appropriate parties to better plan for the future and potentially protect residents from being displaced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology  \n",
    "I was primarily interested in how Denver had or had not gentrified since the legalization of marjiuana in 2014. Therefore, I decided to look at the change in Dnever from 2011 to 2016.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I used the following formula to determine if a census tract had gentrified or not. I compared census data from 2011 with census data from 2016 to make my decision. From Wikipedia:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Whether gentrification has occurred in a census tract in an urban area in the United States during a particular 10-year period between censuses can be determined by a method used in a study by Governing:[50] If the census tract in a central city had 500 or more residents and at the time of the baseline census  \n",
    "<li> had median household income and median home value in the bottom 40th percentile and at the time of the next 10-year census the \n",
    "<li>tract's educational attainment (percentage of residents over age 25 with a bachelor's degree) was in the top 33rd percentile; \n",
    "<li>the median home value, adjusted for inflation, had increased;   \n",
    "<li>and the percentage of increase in home values in the tract was in the top 33rd percentile when compared to the increase in other census tracts in the urban area  \n",
    "then it was considered to have been gentrified.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used this formula to determine which census tracts in Denver have gentrified from 2011 to 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build a predicative model of gentrification, I theorized some variable I believed were early signs of gentrification. I narrowed down my list to the two variables I believed were the biggest signs: new expensive restaurants and new cafes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To build upon this study, I suggest also looking at the opening of art galleries and other institutions relting to art. \n"

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "The common thread through the data explorations was the growth centered in downtown Denver. New restaurants and cafes popped up in high numbers concetrated in downtown Denver. In tandem, four census tracts near downtown Denver were classified as gentrified. These census tracts all were in the bottom 40th percentile for median household value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a clear pattern for why the southern census tracts gentrified.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, my neighborhood, Five Points, was not classified as gentrified. I played with the formula for determining if a census tract had gentrified and was not able to classify Five Points as gentrified. It could be Five Points its too recently gentrified. It could be that the formula used to determine gentrifiction is not well suited to the Denver region.   \n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis above, I conclude that an early sign of gentrifcation for Denver is revitalization and growth downtown. The neighborhoods vulenrable to gentrification are those close to downtown that have cheap housing.  \n",
